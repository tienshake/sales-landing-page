        Here is where you are going to paint the picture of what life could look
        like should this person choose to invest in your ability to in fact
        change their life. And this picture should be mouthwatering and describe
        the exact benefits that you yourself have experienced because of this
        very thing or the very things you teach in this course.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as soon as they have envisioned what is possible, you are going to
        make sure they know that you were once in their shoes. You're going to
        break down all of the frustrations in the next section.

            How about an itemized list of specific pain points? You want these

            where you once were.

            Another specific pain point here and you want it to be very telling
            of where this person might be at emotionally and where you once
            were.

      You are going to tell them all about it right here. But be sure and not
      drag on too long because, remember, this is about them. You want to share
      enough so they no longer feel alone, but the focus is going to be on the
      solution and what they can find for themselves should they invest in your
      services.
