      <p>
        Not to talk about your cat, or your love of chai lattes, or even your
        obsession with The Bachelor. Please leave that for your next IG story.
        Use this opportunity to share your background and how you came to be
        knowledgable in this area. Reiterate the struggles you used to
        experience until you found a better way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Give several examples of how much your life and business changed once
        you put the teachings in your course or product into action. Help to
        paint the picture of what life was then and what it is now. What are the
        incredible experiences you are having today due to the changes you made?
